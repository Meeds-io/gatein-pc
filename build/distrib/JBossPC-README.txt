JBoss Portlet Container
LGPL Licensed (See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html for details on the product usage)

JBoss Portlet Container is the next generation portlet container on which future versions of JBoss
Portal will be based. It provides a standard-compliant implementation of the JSR-286 Portlet 2.0 
specification. It has been developed with reusability in mind so that advanced users, who don't require
a full-fledged portal, can leverage the portlet management services it provides in their own applications.
JBoss Portlet Container is available through the business-friendly LGPL open source license.

This distribution also contains a simple portal built on top of JBoss Portlet Container. This simple
portal can be run on Tomcat 6.x and JBoss Application Server 4.2.x.
